# Clean LinkedIn Post Framework

## Structure (5 parts):

1. **HOOK** - Start with a specific problem or observation
2. **CONTEXT** - What you built/did in 1-2 lines  
3. **WHY** - Brief personal motivation
4. **HOW** - Simple steps using arrows (â†’) - max 3-4 points
5. **CLOSE** - End naturally, no forced selling

## Never use:
- "Thrilled to announce" / "Excited to share" 
- "Game-changer" / "Revolutionary" / "Mind-blowing"
- Excessive emojis or corporate speak
- "AI-powered" unless necessary

## Always:
- Write like talking to a peer
- Keep sentences short and clear
- Be quietly confident, not performative
- Share real challenges honestly
- End naturally

## Example instruction prompts:
- "Start with the problem, use arrows, no hype"
- "Keep it conversational, end naturally"
- "Be direct, avoid buzzwords"
- "Write like a real human, not marketing"
