I got my 12th results yesterday.

Disappointed? Yes, a bit.
Did I expect it? Maybeâ€¦
Do I regret not studying? Not really.

I scored 72%.

I know numbers don't define us, but when you set high standards for yourself, it stings a little.
I've always been that kid who wanted to do it allâ€”be great at studies, excel at every co-curricular activity, build an impact, make money.

Somewhere between hundred rewritten drafts, late-night edits, early-morning deadlinesâ€¦ some things slipped.

If you've been following me since last year, you've seen the journey. You can't have everything, can't be everywhere.

Still gratefulâ€”especially for my parents.

Another significant chapter comes to an end.

When I first worked with clients I dove straight in, thinking I wasn't good enough.
Results felt slow, my 12th-grade schedule collided with freelancing, and I blamed my own skills.

Looking back, I realise the accounts were actually growingâ€”from 0 to 7 000 impressions in two weeks! The real issue? Some clients weren't patient enough.

They wanted viral posts in week 3, 10Ã— engagement in a month, 1 000 followers overnight. When I couldn't match their pace, they quit.

Right clients > Rich clients.

PS â€” You won't please every client. Right clients respect your boundaries and the time great work takes.

From "Never Engineering" to "Why not?"

Remember sharing engineering memes in school? I was that kid who said, "I'll never do engineering."

Fast-forward: I'm three years into an engineering degree. Life's funny like that.

I'm an *accidental* engineer. After 12th I had zero plansâ€”astronaut, pro gamer, YouTuber, who knows. Parents suggested engineering, I shrugged.

First three years? Online classes, bare-minimum study, blah environment.

The wake-up call came at a hackathon: students building cool stuff and *enjoying* it. Engineering could beâ€¦ fun.

Now I'm learning dev, building projects, and actually enjoying the process.

If you're lost in engineering: don't let surroundings limit you. Balance fun and learning. Dive into devâ€”it's cooler than it looks.

I didn't plan to build a tool. I just wanted to share hackathons and internships with students.

The blocker? Formatting. Cleaning raw info into "nice" updates felt like extra work.

So I built **Snipp**â€”paste raw info + link â†’ click *Format* â†’ done.

Launched in a few hours: https://www.snipp.tech/
Waitlist is live, feedback open. Hope this saves you time!

And just like thatâ€”four years of engineering, done.

From day 1 in Dec 2021 to the last paper in May 2025â€”it flew by.

Ups and downs, quiet and busy moments, but it was fun.

21 May: last exam. Unreal that it's over.

Small wins, learnings, growthâ€”I'm carrying them forward. Grateful for lessons, friends, everything in between.

Onward. ðŸš€

Not sure what officially qualifies someone as an **AI Agent Developer**â€¦

But lately I've:
â€¢ Built agents that fetch real-time product data and guide purchases
â€¢ Hooked GPT into paymentsâ€”agents can *move money* based on intent
â€¢ Made Telegram, Slack, and web assistants that converse, clarify, and act
â€¢ Designed fallback flows, ranking logic, memory, context-aware interactions
â€¢ Worked on infra tools like *Payman-powered* Agents and *Kweri*

Maybe I've transitioned from "aspiring" to simply *AI Agent Developer* ðŸ«¡

Still learning, still debugging weird edge cases, but proud of what's shipped and what's next.

Let's build agents that do more than talkâ€”agents that **act**.

Execution > Ideas.

If plans moved mountains, Bill Gates could've coded Microsoft in his sleep.

I've planned, experimented, failedâ€”we all have.

Execution is the 2nd-grade art competition painting, the science fair project, the YouTube channel you actually launched.

I've tried mental-health pages, writing pages, graphic design, YouTube, small businesses, communitiesâ€”most failed.

But here I am, not with a million dollars but with a realisation: execution feeds on **momentum**, not mood.

Building is easy; maintaining is the gameâ€”and it's brutal.

Execution doesn't guarantee success, it guarantees progress. And that's rare.

The show must go on.
