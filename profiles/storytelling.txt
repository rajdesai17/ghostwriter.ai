I got my 12th results yesterday.

Disappointed? Yes, a bit.
Did I expect it? Maybe…
Do I regret not studying? Not really.

I scored 72%.

I know numbers don't define us, but when you set high standards for yourself, it stings a little.
I've always been that kid who wanted to do it all—be great at studies, excel at every co-curricular activity, build an impact, make money.

Somewhere between hundred rewritten drafts, late-night edits, early-morning deadlines… some things slipped.

If you've been following me since last year, you've seen the journey. You can't have everything, can't be everywhere.

Still grateful—especially for my parents.

Another significant chapter comes to an end.

When I first worked with clients I dove straight in, thinking I wasn't good enough.
Results felt slow, my 12th-grade schedule collided with freelancing, and I blamed my own skills.

Looking back, I realise the accounts were actually growing—from 0 to 7 000 impressions in two weeks! The real issue? Some clients weren't patient enough.

They wanted viral posts in week 3, 10× engagement in a month, 1 000 followers overnight. When I couldn't match their pace, they quit.

Right clients > Rich clients.

PS — You won't please every client. Right clients respect your boundaries and the time great work takes.

From "Never Engineering" to "Why not?"

Remember sharing engineering memes in school? I was that kid who said, "I'll never do engineering."

Fast-forward: I'm three years into an engineering degree. Life's funny like that.

I'm an *accidental* engineer. After 12th I had zero plans—astronaut, pro gamer, YouTuber, who knows. Parents suggested engineering, I shrugged.

First three years? Online classes, bare-minimum study, blah environment.

The wake-up call came at a hackathon: students building cool stuff and *enjoying* it. Engineering could be… fun.

Now I'm learning dev, building projects, and actually enjoying the process.

If you're lost in engineering: don't let surroundings limit you. Balance fun and learning. Dive into dev—it's cooler than it looks.

I didn't plan to build a tool. I just wanted to share hackathons and internships with students.

The blocker? Formatting. Cleaning raw info into "nice" updates felt like extra work.

So I built **Snipp**—paste raw info + link → click *Format* → done.

Launched in a few hours: https://www.snipp.tech/
Waitlist is live, feedback open. Hope this saves you time!

And just like that—four years of engineering, done.

From day 1 in Dec 2021 to the last paper in May 2025—it flew by.

Ups and downs, quiet and busy moments, but it was fun.

21 May: last exam. Unreal that it's over.

Small wins, learnings, growth—I'm carrying them forward. Grateful for lessons, friends, everything in between.

Onward. 🚀

Not sure what officially qualifies someone as an **AI Agent Developer**…

But lately I've:
• Built agents that fetch real-time product data and guide purchases
• Hooked GPT into payments—agents can *move money* based on intent
• Made Telegram, Slack, and web assistants that converse, clarify, and act
• Designed fallback flows, ranking logic, memory, context-aware interactions
• Worked on infra tools like *Payman-powered* Agents and *Kweri*

Maybe I've transitioned from "aspiring" to simply *AI Agent Developer* 🫡

Still learning, still debugging weird edge cases, but proud of what's shipped and what's next.

Let's build agents that do more than talk—agents that **act**.

Execution > Ideas.

If plans moved mountains, Bill Gates could've coded Microsoft in his sleep.

I've planned, experimented, failed—we all have.

Execution is the 2nd-grade art competition painting, the science fair project, the YouTube channel you actually launched.

I've tried mental-health pages, writing pages, graphic design, YouTube, small businesses, communities—most failed.

But here I am, not with a million dollars but with a realisation: execution feeds on **momentum**, not mood.

Building is easy; maintaining is the game—and it's brutal.

Execution doesn't guarantee success, it guarantees progress. And that's rare.

The show must go on.

NOW AI AGENTS CAN MOVE MONEY.

What made that possible? Payman!

Before I show you what I built, here’s what Payman is:
⚡Payman is a secure financial platform that lets AI agents move real money — without ever giving them direct access to user funds.
Think of it as the missing trust layer between AI and finance, with built-in controls, approvals, and full compliance baked in.

So recently, I participated in Payman AI Dev Challenge #2 where I built two AI agents that do more than chat — they transact.

1. GiftAgent, an AI-powered birthday gift automation platform that helps you never miss a birthday and send thoughtful gifts to your loved ones. You can:
→ Schedule a gift in advance for any contact
 → Just say, “Send flowers to Mom tomorrow” — it handles the rest
 → It fetches gift ideas, tracks preferences, and triggers payment via Payman
Flow: Sign up → Add contacts → Schedule or chat → Gift delivered. Fully automated.

2. AgentVC, a fun LLM-powered mock investor. You pitch a startup → it asks you questions → rates your pitch → and funds your idea with TSD$ if it likes the pitch.
→ Fully chat-based
 → Gives honest feedback
 → If your pitch score ≥ 6, it sends TSD$ to your wallet via Payman

🔐 Both agents use Payman OAuth and SDK to securely authorize and trigger wallet-based transactions inside AI flows.
Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind, Supabase for storage, and deployed via Vercel in under a week.

• Payman was rock solid — clean docs and smooth integration,
agents can now think, decide, and move money — safely and programmatically.

It's great to see how fast the AI x Finance is evolving.🚀
